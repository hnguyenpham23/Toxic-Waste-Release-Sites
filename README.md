## Background
### What is a Superfund Site?
Superfund sites are locations across the United States where uncontrolled releases of hazardous substances into the air, water, and soil have occurred, posing risks to human health and the environment. These sites can result from industrial accidents, improper waste disposal practices, or other activities that have led to contamination.

When sites pose significant risks and require long-term cleanup efforts, they may be added to the National Priorities List (NPL) by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The NPL identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the country and prioritizes them for remediation under the Superfund program.

The Superfund program was established by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, commonly known as the Superfund Act. This legislation provided the legal framework and funding for the cleanup and remediation of polluted and contaminated lands. The primary goal of the Superfund program is to protect human health and the environment by addressing the risks posed by hazardous waste sites.

Superfund sites undergo a comprehensive process of investigation, evaluation, and cleanup, which may involve containment, removal, or treatment of hazardous substances to prevent further environmental degradation and mitigate risks to public health. The cleanup process can be complex and may require the coordination of multiple stakeholders, including federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private entities responsible for the contamination.

In addition to cleanup efforts, the Superfund program also focuses on holding responsible parties accountable for the costs of remediation through a process known as "polluter pays." This involves identifying parties responsible for the contamination and requiring them to either clean up the site themselves or contribute financially to the cleanup efforts.

Overall, Superfund sites represent a commitment to addressing environmental pollution and protecting communities from the adverse effects of hazardous substances. Through the Superfund program, efforts are made to remediate contaminated sites, restore ecosystems, and safeguard public health for present and future generations.
